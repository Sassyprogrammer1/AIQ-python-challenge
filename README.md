# AIQ-python-challenge
This repo contains the python challenge. I couldn't implement color map unfortunately as I didn't have enough time and I needed research for that as I was implementing it for the first time. I couldn't manage time to write unit tests due to lack of time.

The resized images has already been saved in the db. It is done by the upload_csv.py. The data is saved in the mongo atlas and the frames can directly be accessed after running the project.

# start

```
    bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose up
```

you can access the api at

```http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs```
